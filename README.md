I'm a Frontend Software Engineer and UI designer currently based in Lagos, Nigeria. I work across the stack but I lean more towards the frontend because I love design (ðŸ˜Ž), and building aesthetically-pleasing, sleek and performant web and mobile apps. I've tinkered with Python and Java but JavaScript is always my goto language. I think code should be self-explanatory but it doesn't hurt to add comments. (ðŸ˜‰)

I currently work as a freelance frontend engineer but I'm open to fulltime onsite/remote roles.
